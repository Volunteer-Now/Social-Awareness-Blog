In today’s fast-moving data-driven world, people who don’t have exposure to technology are bound to be at a disadvantage. A specific group of our community is especially vulnerable to this. Seniors. That’s right. Our seniors who populate book clubs and walk in the parks are vulnerable as society becomes increasingly reliant on the use of technology to relay information. Only 40% of older adults use smartphones, and that rate declines to 17% among adults aged eighty plus. Internet usage is slightly higher, but more than a quarter of older adults lack access to the internet [[1](https://news.utexas.edu/2020/03/11/digital-generation-gap-turns-health-crisis-into-information-crisis-for-older-people/#:~:text=Only%2040%25%20of%20older%20adults,help%20setting%20up%20digital%20devices)].

Having said that, We need to invest in training the most vulnerable generation to use digital technology and support service organizations that cater to seniors [[1](https://news.utexas.edu/2020/03/11/digital-generation-gap-turns-health-crisis-into-information-crisis-for-older-people/#:~:text=Only%2040%25%20of%20older%20adults,help%20setting%20up%20digital%20devices)]. Personally, I can keep in touch with my friends, attend conferences and write articles from home even during the pandemic. However, someone in their 80s with no internet access will have a hard time even getting information about safety procedures from the city. According to The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports the overall death rate from the disease at 2.3% of people who are infected, but that rate is 15% among adults over the age of 80 and 49% of adults who were critically ill [[1](https://news.utexas.edu/2020/03/11/digital-generation-gap-turns-health-crisis-into-information-crisis-for-older-people/#:~:text=Only%2040%25%20of%20older%20adults,help%20setting%20up%20digital%20devices)]. This is more the reason to bridge the digital gap in the generations.

Taking into consideration the problem above, <b>Cyber-Seniors</b>— A non-profit organization —aims to tackle this problem by connecting youth mentors with seniors. <b>Cyber-Seniors</b> began as a high school project in 2009 and became a non-profit organization in 2015. The organization tries to bridge the digital gap through the development and dissemination of resources that enable community organizations to provide tech-training for senior citizens using an intergenerational, youth volunteer model. Some of their initiatives currently include Info sessions for seniors, youth 1-1 lessons to help them with technology, and cyber-seniors programs at many different locations [[2](https://cyberseniors.org/)]. You can get involved by becoming a volunteer for the youth 1-1 lesson [here](https://cyberseniors.org/volunteers/) or you can donate [here](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=8GBN424BTFPTU). The organization Served 10,000 youth & seniors with the Cyber-Seniors program so far and you can join them to help bridge the digital divide between the generations [[2](https://cyberseniors.org/)]. Cyber-Seniors also attended and presented during the <b><a href="https://von-fair.netlify.app">VON Fair 2021</a></b> and gave out information about the info.
