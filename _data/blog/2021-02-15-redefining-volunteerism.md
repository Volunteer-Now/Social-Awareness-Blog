Wake up⏰. Turn on laptop💻. Sit at desk till 8pm. Sleep🛌. Repeat🔁.

Sound familiar?

Many of us have spent almost a year stuck at home. Our lacklustre routines have become the norm. Early on in the <s>panoramic</s> pandemic, many of us had to cut back on our extracurricular activities. This was both a relief and a burden. I for one found myself relieved to have a break from my volunteering commitments. But as the days went on, life became dull. The same empty spots in my schedule that brought me immense joy left an uncomfortable void that couldn’t be filled.
<br>

And that's when it <b><i>clicked</i></b>.
<br>

These commitments had more value in my life than the checkmark on my diploma or the resume boosters for my university applications.
<br>

<b>Volunteering</b> has many benefits. You’re not only contributing to important causes and strengthening the greater community, but you’re also benefiting yourself (Calvin). It teaches you valuable skills, increases your self-confidence and boosts motivation (Benefit of Community Service). Volunteering doesn’t always have to be a long-term commitment either, even giving your time in smaller ways can still make a large impact (Calvin).



So how can <b>you</b> get involved in the middle of a <b>global <s>pericyclic</s> pandemic?</b>



<b>Attend the VON Fair!</b> The VON Fair will be taking place on <b>Wednesday, February 17th, 2021 from 4-6pm</b>. Organizations such as Fridays for the Future, The Urban Garden Initiative and the Toronto Youth Cabinet will be present, so you’ll be able to connect and meet with them personally. It’s the perfect opportunity to find a volunteering position tailored to your needs and wants, so we hope to see you there!
<br>

<mark>And remember, the change starts with <b>you!</b></mark>
