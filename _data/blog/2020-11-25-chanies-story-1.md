### **Trigger Warning: Mentions of physical and sexual abuse of children.**

November 17th, 2020 marks the day VON began this year’s “Wenjack Walk” initiative, this time as “Wenjack Week” due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the changes that came along with it. This article will explain who Chanie Wenjack is, his story, and the wider impact of residential schools on Indigenous peoples and Canadian history.

Chanie Wenjack lived with his parents and two sisters on the Marten Falls reserve in the middle of Northern Ontario, before he was taken over 600 kilometres away to the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School where he would spend the final 3-4 years of his life[[1](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/charlie-wenjack)]. At age 12, Chanie and two of his friends ran away; 9 other children also ran away that day[[1](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/charlie-wenjack)]. He followed his friends to meet their uncle who lived 31 kilometres away from Cecilia Jeffrey, before setting out on his own with only light clothing and a couple of matches[[1](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/charlie-wenjack)]. He was able to walk 19 kilometres over 36 hours through the harsh weather with no food or water, before dying on October 23rd, 1966, a week after he left[[1](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/charlie-wenjack)]. His body was discovered on the side of the railway tracks with bruises, indicating he had fallen several times[[1](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/charlie-wenjack)]. An inquest into his death was launched, which found that “the Indian education system causes tremendous emotional and adjustment problems for these children” and recommended that “a study be made of the present Indian education and philosophy” and began to amplify what Indigenous people had been saying for years[[1](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/charlie-wenjack)].

The jury of the inquest determined that Chanie Wenjack ran away because he was lonely; Wenjack had told students he wanted to see his father; Wenjack’s sister, Pearl, believes that he may have ran away because he was sexually assaulted[[1](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/charlie-wenjack)]. Unfortunately, there are plenty of other stories similar to Chanie’s. 150,000 Indigenous children were forced to attend residential schools, with several thousand either dead or missing[[2](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/residential-schools)]. There are countless stories of physical abuse, which stemmed from excessive physical punishment, and sexual abuse by predatory staff[[2](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/residential-schools)]. Additionally, many students did not receive enough to eat and the ensuing malnutrition led many to succumb to preventable diseases[[2](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/residential-schools)]. Residential schools also served as a tool for cultural genocide, since their purpose was to assimilate Indigenous people into white, Christian, Canadian society. This was done by transporting thousands of children away from their homes and communities, forbidding the usage of their languages and isolating them for their cultures[[2](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/residential-schools)]. Residential schools have left immeasurable harm on survivors, families and communities.

As Canadians work towards reconciliation with Canada’s Indigenous peoples, we must continue to spread awareness about our country’s past, present and future through campaigns and initiatives such as this one.
